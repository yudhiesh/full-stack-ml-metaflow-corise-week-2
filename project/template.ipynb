    "## Task 1: Training and Evaluating Sentiment Analysis Models Using Metaflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you'll use Metaflow to build two machine learning models for sentiment analysis: a baseline *\"majority class\"* classifier and your own custom model. You'll then train both models in parallel and experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize their performance. Finally, you'll use this notebook and the Metaflow Client API to analyze the results of your different models and hyperparameters. Here's what you'll need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Build the Workflows\n",
    "The first step in this task is to build the workflow(s) for sentiment analysis using the Metaflow framework. Start by creating a new flow in Metaflow and implementing the baseline *\"majority class\"* classifier. Then, build your own custom classifier using techniques you learned in Week 1, or any [helpful resources](https://outerbounds.com/docs/nlp-tutorial-L2/) you'd like. For your custom model, be sure to include steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Train Both Models in Parallel\n",
    "Once you've built your models, the next step is to train both models in parallel using the Metaflow framework. Use Metaflow to run both training jobs in parallel steps. If you get stuck, you may want to review the [FlowSpec branching documentation](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics#branch).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Experiment with Hyperparameters\n",
    "After you've trained both models in parallel, the next step is to experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize their performance. Try different values for hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, and record the results for each combination of hyperparameters as Data Artifacts in Metaflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Analyze the Results\n",
    "Finally, use this notebook and the Metaflow Client API to analyze the results of your different models and hyperparameters. Create visualizations to compare the performance of the two models and identify the best hyperparameters for each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this task, you'll gain experience working with the Metaflow framework and learn how to build and optimize machine learning workflows for sentiment analysis."

    "## Task 2: Anticipating Failure in Your Machine Learning Project\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you'll practice anticipating potential failure modes in a sentiment analysis classifier and develop strategies to mitigate them. Here's what you'll need to do:\n",
    "### Step 1: Identify Potential Failure Modes\n",
    "The first step in anticipating failure in your machine learning project is to identify potential failure modes. Start by brainstorming ways in which your project could fail from an engineering point of view. For example, your model could overfit to the training data or suffer from data bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Bias: The dataset could be biased towards a particular group or sentiment, leading to a model that is not representative of the broader population.\n",
    "- Overfitting: The model could perform well on the training data but poorly on new data due to overfitting.\n",
    "- Outliers: The presence of outliers in the data could skew the model's predictions.\n",
    "- Insufficient Data: There may not be enough data to build a robust model.\n",
    "- Feature Engineering: The model's performance could be limited by poor feature engineering.\n",
    "- Inappropriate Model Selection: Choosing the wrong type of model for the problem could lead to poor performance.\n",
    "- Lack of domain knowledge: Lack of knowledge in the domain the model is built for can lead to poor model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Develop Strategies to Mitigate Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've identified potential failure modes, the next step is to develop strategies to mitigate them. Think about what measures you could take to fix the issue if it were to occur. For example, if your model is overfitting to the training data, you could try regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to reduce the complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data bias: Collect a diverse set of training data that includes samples from various demographics and backgrounds to avoid bias in the model.\n",
    "- Overfitting: Use regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "- Lack of data: Use data augmentation techniques such as word embeddings or synthetic data generation to increase the amount of available training data.\n",
    "- Outliers: Use robust statistical techniques such as median absolute deviation or interquartile range to identify and remove outliers from the dataset before training the model.\n",
    "- Model complexity: Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to find the simplest model that still achieves good performance on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Plan Ahead to Avoid Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it's important to plan ahead to avoid potential failure modes in the first place. Think about what you could have done initially to avoid these failure modes. For example, you could have collected a diverse set of training data to reduce data bias or experimented with different model architectures to find the best solution for your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to anticipating failure in your machine learning project is to be proactive rather than reactive. By identifying potential failure modes ahead of time and developing strategies to mitigate them, you'll be better equipped to build a successful machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Collection: Collect a diverse set of training data to reduce data bias. Ensure that the data is representative of the real-world scenarios and covers a wide range of use cases.\n",
    "- Feature Engineering: Use feature engineering techniques to transform the raw data into meaningful features that capture the important aspects of the problem. This can help in reducing the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- Model Selection: Experiment with different model architectures to find the best solution for your problem. Try out different algorithms and models to determine which one works best for your dataset.\n",
